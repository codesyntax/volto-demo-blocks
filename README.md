# Volto Demo Blocks (volto-demo-blocks)

An addon for Volto thatt contains some dummy blocks. The code on this block is a demo you can copy to your project. Its aim is to show how simple blocks are built using components provided by Volto

## Features

This addon provides 6 different Volto Blocks. They are meant to be used as demo-code to learn how Volto Blocks are created.

You can copy-and-paste the code into your project and modify where required.

All block code is compatible with the [Block style wrapper](https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/blocks/block-style-wrapper.html) so either the values coming from the `styling` schema (if available) or class names added by the [styleClassNameExtenders](https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/configuration/settings-reference.html#term-styleClassNameExtenders) will be available in your blocks.

### Block 01: custom schema, no View and no Edit components

This block uses Volto provided View and Edit components. It only configures a custom schema with a URL and a title.

This block shows how Volto provides the Edit component automatically, without needing to add any boilerplate. It also shows that Volto provides a very simple View component that renders all values in the schema.


### Block 02: custom schema and View. No Edit component

This block uses Volto provided Edit component. It configures a custom schema with a URL and a title and provides also a View component.

This block shows how we can configure a simple block with some fields and build a custom view component for it without worrying about the Edit component.

### Block 03: custom View and Edit components

This block uses custom View and Edit components. As we are using a custom Edit component, there is no need to configure the block schema.

This block shows how we can create a simple block with custom View and Edit components. The Edit component featured here is a basic one where we just inject a schema in it.

### Block 04: custom View and schema, and manual variations

This block uses a custom view component and defines a schema for it. But the schema features a special field called `variation` and also a list of available `variations` in the block configuration.

This block shows how to create a *manual* implementation of variations and how we call the selected variation's template.

### Block 05: custom View and variations provided by Volto

This block uses a custom view component and makes use of the `withBlockExtensions` HOC that Volto provides to provide variations.

This block shows how we can build a block that uses variations. Just wrapping the view component definition with the `withBlockExtensions` HOC, and providing a list of variations in the block config.

### Block 06: custom View, variations provided by Volto, and schema enhancing in a given variation

This block uses a custom view component and makes use of the `withBlockExtensions` HOC that Volto provides to provide variations. One of the variation uses a schema enhancer to provide additional fields to the block when using this variation.

This block shows how we can build a block that uses variations. Just wrapping the view component definition with the `withBlockExtensions` HOC, and providing a list of variations in the block config. Moreover, it shows how we can use the schema enhancing functionality to add additional fields to the block when using a given variation.

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon volto-demo-blocks
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `volto-demo-blocks` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "volto-demo-blocks"
],

"dependencies": {
    "volto-demo-blocks": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `volto-demo-blocks` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "volto-demo-blocks": "*"
}
```

Add `volto-demo-blocks` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['volto-demo-blocks'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = 'volto-demo-blocks';
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
